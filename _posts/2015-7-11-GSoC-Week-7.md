### So Far

[PR 9575](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9575) and [PR
9495](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9495) got merged this week. All the
basic functions are now in place in `polys.ring_series`. The module supports
Laurent as well as Puiseux series expansion. The order of the day is to
extend this support for nested functions, and encapsulate the whole thing with
classes. The idea is that the user need not bother about calling `ring_series`
functions and that the class should hold all the relevant information about the
series.

Given that SymPy already has `series` infrastructure, we need to decide whether
`ring_series` with be integrated with it or whether it will be distinct from it.

### Next Week

* Discuss and decide how `ring_series` is to be used and write its classes
accordingly. I will build upon [PR 9614](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9614)

* Write a `series` function that makes use of `ring_series` functions to expand
arbitrary expressions.

I also need to start porting some of it to Symengine. The basic polynomial
operations are in place there. I need to discuss with Ondrej and Sumith how the
series module will best work with the Polynomial module. If that is sorted, I
can start porting the `ring_series` functions.

Cheers!
