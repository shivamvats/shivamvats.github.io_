This week I started work on writing the series module for symengine. I am
working with [Sumith](https://github.com/Sumith1896) on Polynomials on [PR
511](https://github.com/sympy/symengine/pull/511). It is still a work in
progress. A lot of the code, especially related to Piranha was new to me, so I
had to read a lot. I got a [PR 533](https://github.com/sympy/symengine/pull/533)
merged which uses templates to simplify code for equality and comparison of
maps.

With regard to [PR 9614](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9614), I had a
meeting with my mentor Thilina. We decided that we should be able to call the 
`RingSeries` function on SymPy `Basic` expressions so that the user need not
bother about creating rings and all the extra function calls. So, I will be
building on top of the classes I created earlier to make the `series` method
accept `Basic` expressions. I created `RingFunction`, `RingMul` and `RingAdd`
classes. The `taylor_series` method now works with sums and products of
functions. However, it is still not optimised, especially with series that have
a low minimum exponent (say cos). I need to find a better way.

I returned to college. Once classes begin from Monday I will need to manage my
time well as my schedule will get busier.

### Next Week

* Finish the [Polynomials PR](https://github.com/sympy/symengine/pull/511).

* Further optimise the `taylor_series` method to work in all cases.

* Start writing a `series` method that works with `Basic` expressions.

I think it is good to have the flexibility to work with `Basic` objects as that
integrates the `ring_series` module better with the existing `series`
infrastructure of SymPy. At the end of day, we want maximum number of people to
benefit from using the code.

Cheers!
