title: Hey there!

I am applying for Google Summer of Code, 2015. It is an annual program sponsored
by Google, that pays students to contribute to open source organizations of
their choice. My application involves two symbolic computation libraries - Sympy
and CSymPy, the former written in Python and the latter in C++. CSymPy is meant
to be a fast cousin of Sympy and can be used with optional wrappers.

I am proposing to implement fast series expansion in CSymPy and Sympy. Sympy
already has series expansion, but suffers from speed issues and lack of a class
structure. You can look at my full proposal [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2015-Application--Shivam-Vats-:-Series-expansions)

I will use this blog to write about my GSoC experience, if I am selected.

I welcome your suggestions.

Cheers!
