title: GSoC Week 5
---

I am almost half way through my project and it has been an amazing learning
experience. According to my timeline I am supposed to finish `ring_series` work
in SymPy by the mid-eval (i.e, by next week) and start porting it to Symengine
after it. Though I faced some hiccups, especially in figuring out how to deal
with a symbolic ring, the deadline is achievable.

### Till now

* Series reversion has been added to `ring_series` after [this
PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9566) of mine got merged.

* I have started modifying the functions to operate on constant terms in the
input series with [this PR]([https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9575). I plan
to finish it by this week. We are using the `EX` domain to represent the
symbolic coefficients.

* [The PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9495) to add puiseux series has
not been yet merged. I have added a `check_precision` function that gives an
approximate number of iterations with which the `ring_series` functions will
output the series of the requested order.

### Next Week

I expect both the pending pull requests to get merged by this week. After that
the only major task remaining, would be to write the new `Series` class
structure. So, the tasks are:

* Discuss and write the new `Series` class structure.

* Finish pending tasks, if any, and write more tests.
