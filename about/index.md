I am a 4th year undergraduate student of Mathematics and Computing at Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagapur. I am a robotics enthusiast, like
programming and love to see abstract mathematical ideas being used in real-life
applications.

I regularly contribute to open source development. In 2015, I did my Google Summer of
Code project in SymPy on series expansion. I remain an active member of the
community.

Currently, I am interning under Prof. Maxim Likhachev at Search Based Planning
Lab in Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I am working on full body
planning for the PR2 robot and also hope to explore the intersection of topology
and multi heuristic A* search.
