I am a 2nd year undergraduate student of Mathematics and Computing at Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagapur. I love mathematics, especially abstract
algebra and number theory. I also love programming, and developing software that
has an impact on people and makes their lives easier. This is why I am also an
active open-source contributer.
